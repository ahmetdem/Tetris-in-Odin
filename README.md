# Tetris-in-Odin

## Overview
- A Classic Tetris Game which i created to get used to Odin language and basics of game development without an engine.

- Odin was super fun to code on and very user friendly. Especially in these times where OOP is everywhere, Odin really brought me fresh air. Will continue to use it on my other Projects!

## Usage
Just install the [Odin Compiler](https://odin-lang.org/) and type:
```bash
odin run .
```

The game should Compile and you are free to go and enjoy!
